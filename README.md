# Discord Bot - Channel Access with Password Authentication

## Overview

This Discord bot project is designed to provide password authentication for accessing specific channels. It includes features such as command-based access, AFK status setting, and more.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-discord-bot-project.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd your-discord-bot-project
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Configure the bot:
   - Open the `config.js` file and replace placeholder values with your Discord bot token, application ID, and guild ID.

5. Run the bot:
   ```bash
   node your-bot-file.js
   ```

## Features

### 1. Access Command

The bot provides a command `/access` for accessing a channel. Users need to enter a password to gain access. If the password is correct, the bot grants access and adjusts channel permissions.

### 2. AFK Command

The bot also supports an `/afk` command, allowing users to set themselves as AFK (Away From Keyboard). This command updates the user's permissions in the designated channel.

## Usage

- Use the `/access` command to initiate the authentication process.
- Use the `/afk` command to set yourself as AFK.

## Configuration

Ensure that you have the following configuration in your `config.js` file:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  YOUR_BOT_TOKEN: 'your-bot-token',
  YOUR_APPLICATION_ID: 'your-application-id',
  GUILD_ID: 'your-guild-id',
};
```

Replace `'your-bot-token'`, `'your-application-id'`, and `'your-guild-id'` with your actual bot token, application ID, and guild ID.
